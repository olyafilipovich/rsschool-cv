## About myself

I started my career as an engineer in Belkomunproect. I went from a simple engineer to the head of a design team. For 7 years I made many projects in whole Belarus.

When work turned into a routine, I decided to radically change the field of activity and went into catering. Working in a coffee shop, I became more sociable, my circle of acquaintances expanded. I am not afraid to take on serious tasks, I am attentive to details.

Thanks to my work, I have enough free time, which I spend for studying and hobbies. Recently I have finished course of UX UI Design. After doing a few study/test tasks, I became interested to know how my design can be turned into a “live” website.

I believe, that my desire to learn and to gain new skills let me become professional Frontend Developer and create and create stylish user-friendly websites.
